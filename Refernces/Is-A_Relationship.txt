It can be handled through 3 approaches.

1. Table per class: In this case, 1 single table will be created and with the help of descriminator column we will able to
   identify the record belong from which scenario.
   Ex: 3 types of employee - Admin/software/Hardware each having a unique property.
   So in this case when we insert the data with reference to admin the unique property field of
   software and hardware will be filled as null and descriminator column will contain the type admin.
   
   Refer to program: Table per class - Is a relationship
   
   
   
2. Table per subClass: In this case, multiple tables will be created and will be linked with the help of primary key and foriegn key.
   For the above scenario 4 tables will be created:
   a. Employee
   b. SoftwareEmployee
   c. HardwareEmployee
   d. Admin
   
   employee table will contain the common information and other 3 tables will contain the unique fields and linked with primary table with the help 
   of primary key and foriegn key.
   
   Refer to program: Table per Subclass - Is a relationship
   
   
3. Table per concrete class: In this case, separate table will be created for each class and each table will contain every field.
